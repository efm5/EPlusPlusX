An extension to Explorer++ version 1.3.5

From the original readme:
Explorer++ is a free multi-tab file manager for Windows.

Available on Windows XP and above, it features the same
familiar interface as Windows Explorer, while introducing
several enhancements and improvements for a much richer
file browsing experience.
